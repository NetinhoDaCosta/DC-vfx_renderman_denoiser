# DC-vfx_renderman_denoiser
Allows Pixar Renderman users to denoise after the render process.
This means that you can use the denoiser based on rendered exr files on disk.

A few tips to make everything work as expected:
* Make sure the folder where your render sequence is located does not contain special characters or spaces
* Everytime you denoise, make sure to close the application (in order to clear memory) and open it again to denoise
